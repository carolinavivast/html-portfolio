<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie because it teach us that we should seize the day and make our lives extraordinary. </p>
<h3>Butterfly Effect</h3>
<p>The butterfly effect asks us to be thoughtful with our decisions because we never know what the consequences of those decisions are.</p>
<h3>Master and Margarita</h3>
<p> It's a nice film based on Mikhail Bulgakov's novel “Master and Margarita“</p>
